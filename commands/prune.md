Interactively clean up stale Claude Code memories.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**Parse arguments:**
- If `--dry-run` is present: show what would be flagged without taking action
- If a project name is given: filter to that project
- Otherwise: scan all projects

**Step 1: Get staleness data**

bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/memory-dashboard.sh" --project PROJECT_IF_SPECIFIED

**Step 2: Present flagged memories**

For each memory with staleness score > 50, sorted by score descending:

1. Show the full file content
2. Show staleness score, age, type, and reasons
3. Show recommended action (review or prune)

If `--dry-run`: just show the list and stop.

**Step 3: Interactive cleanup**

For each flagged memory, ask the user to choose:

- **Delete** — Before deleting, print the full file content to the conversation (backup in transcript). Then remove the file and its entry from MEMORY.md.
- **Archive** — Move file to `memory/archive/` subdirectory. Remove MEMORY.md entry. (Not available for standalone MEMORY.md layout — offer Delete or Keep instead.)
- **Keep** — Touch the file to reset mtime: `touch <filepath>`. This resets the staleness clock.
- **Edit** — Show current content, ask user what to change, apply via Edit tool, then keep.
- **Skip** — Move to next memory without action.

**Step 4: Summary**

Report actions taken: N deleted, N archived, N kept, N edited, N skipped.
Report estimated tokens saved (sum of deleted + archived memory token estimates).
